### [Image captioning](https://github.com/federico1-creator/AI4A)
Project for **AI for Automotive** course - UNIMORE 2021

![](/images/AI4A.jpg){:height="200" width="400"}

In the last years the Transfromer-based models reached the SOTA for the Sequence modelling.
In the project I have build a system for *Image captioning*.
This type of system, consider as input the image and text (multimodal)
and describe through the natural language the image. 

Tranformer - Attention operator - Image captioning - COCO - CIDEr - Multimodal - text - image - Sequence model

### [Design a new pipeline to make a Virtual Try-On from a deep learning perspective](https://github.com/federico1-creator/CV-CS)
Project for **Computer Vision & Cognitive Systems** course - UNIMORE 2021

![](/images/VITON.jpg){:height="150" width="350"}

Creation of a pipeline for a *virtual try-on* to simulate trying on new clothes.  For this project I have used a dataset build with the collaboration of *Yoox*.
In this direction, also a retrieval system was implement. To suggest at the final users the most similar cloths respect to those worn, in the catalogues.
To create the *geometric transformation*, that allows you to simulate the wearing of the new dress, a neural network was used that allows you to learn the best transformation.

### [Reinforcement Learning with a single agent model free](https://github.com/federico1-creator/Distributed-AI)
Project for **Distributed Artificial Intelligence** course - UNIMORE 2021

![](/images/image.png){:height="150" width="350"}

I investigated the use of a single agent model-free in various environments, from the simplest to the most complex ones.
Initially the agent does not know the environment in which it operates, but during training it learns what actions (policy) to perform to complete the task correctly.
The algorithms used were Q-learning and DQN.
I also compared the results obtained, also considering changes of some hyperparameters.

### [Hackathon on COVID-19](https://github.com/federico1-creator/covid-hackathon)
Project for hackathon on COVID-19

![](/images/final.jpg){:height="200" width="400"}

The purpose of this work is to define an explainable way to define if a COVID patient health status is "MILD" or "SEVERE" using an algorithm which elaborates clinical data and x-rays. The goal is to achieve good performance in the prediction using a well explinable approach.
To avoid the black box in a safety critical domain as healthcare.

### [CoViRo: control robot through a hand gesture recognition system](https://github.com/federico1-creator/gesture_robot)
Project for **Smart Robotics** course - UNIMORE 2022

![](/images/SR.jpg){:height="200" width="400"}

The group work led to the creation of a simulation of the franka robot, controlled without the use of any controller but through gestures.
To do this, a vision system has been created capable of classifying the different labels.
By exploiting keypoints and a simple Neural Network, we were able to do this with an high accuracy (96%) and in real time.
Using ROS communications, demos were then created to show the potential of the implemented system. 
The robot was controlled with MoveIt in the cpp language.

### [Anomaly prediction with Temporal Convolutional Networks and Data Augmentation in High Performance Computing Systems](https://github.com/federico1-creator/Thesis)
**Bachelor thesis** - UNIBO 2020 

![](/images/prova_tesi_L.jpg){:height="200" width="450"}

The thesis work investigated anomaly prediction methodologies of anomalies in the LEONARDO HPC system located at the CINECA.
We used *Machine Learning* techniques, creating a 1-D convolutional network to analyze the input time series.
To improve the performance of the system, *data augmentation* techniques were used, given the high imbalance in the dataset between correct examples and system faults.

### [Health detector](https://github.com/federico1-creator/HEALTH-DETECTOR)
Project for **IoT & 3D systems** course - UNIMORE 2021 

![](/images/IoT.jpg){:height="200" width="400"}

The project has created a health monitoring system for *patients / users* by evaluating different data acquired from sensors controlled with Arduino. With these data, an intelligent management has been implemented to predict the patient's state of health, relying on artificial intelligence to study the evolution of time series.
To facilitate the creation of a possible prototype, a 3D model of the object was acquired using a point cloud.
The work aims to provide more effective tools to patients and doctors to assess the state of health and act with proactive operations in case of need.

### [Re-design the New Holland tractor interface, of the group *CNH*](https://github.com/federico1-creator/HowIMetYourTractor)
Project for **User Experience Design** course - UNIMORE 2021 

![](/images/uxd.jpg){:height="200" width="400"}

Following the phases of the *design cycle*, initially research on competitors was carried out and various factors analyzed on users using techniques such as personas, interviews, analysis of usage scenarios. Then a House of quality (HOQ) was created with requirements and requests.
Once the idea was identified, various concepts were created (first low-fidelity and then high-fidelity) and an ergonomic analysis of the cabin with the new design to verify the interaction with the user. In conclusion, usability tests were carried out with volunteers, to objectively evaluate the results.

### [INAFARM](https://github.com/federico1-creator/INAFarm)
Project for the course of **Innovation, development, entrepreneurship** at **Almalabor**

![](/images/INAFARM.jpg){:height="200" width="400"}

The project was based on a strong multidisciplinary nature of the group, which developed its own creative idea right from the first stages of brain storming and identification of the idea to then carry out the practical realization. 
Thanks to the equipment available through the Almalabor laboratory. The course concluded with the presentation of the project results.

### [Packaging machine for yogurt](https://github.com/federico1-creator/Progetto-macchina-yogourt)
Project for the course of **Macchine automatiche**

![](/images/yogurt.jpg){:height="200" width="400"}

Analysis and sizing of an automatic yogurt packaging machine. Evaluation of all forces and movements in action to identify design constraints 
and size the various actuators. Creation of a 3D model of the automatic system for closing and handling yogurt-filled jars. 
The objective of the project was to evaluate the various stages of implementation of the pneumatic system used for the cylindrical actuators.
